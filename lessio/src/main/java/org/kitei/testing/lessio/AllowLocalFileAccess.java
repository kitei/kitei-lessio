/**
 * Under the regime of {@link LessIOSecurityManager}, only classes annotated
 * with this annotation may perform IO on local files. Such annotated classes
 * will only be allowed to access the paths specified in {@link #paths()}.
 *
 * The following values are recognized for {@link #paths()}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>%TMP_DIR%, allows IO to anything inside the JVM's temporary directory, as
 * per the <i>java.io.tmpdir system property</i> as retrieved via
 * {@link System#getProperty(String)}</li>
 * <li>%FD%, allows IO via any file descriptor</li>
 * <li>*, allows IO to any file or directory (path)</li>
 * <li>*[part]*, allows IO to any path which contains [part]</li>
 * <li>*[part], allows IO to any path which ends with [part]</li>
 * <li>[part]*, allows IO to any path which starts with [part]</li>
 * <li>all other values, allow IO to any path which exactly matches the value</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that due to performance restrictions, the {@link LessIOSecurityManager}
 * only performs textual matches, and does not recognize symbolic links or hard
 * links.
 *
