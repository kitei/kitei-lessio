/**
 * Under the regime of {@link LessIOSecurityManager}, only classes annotated
 * with this annotation may manipulate network sockets. {@link #endpoints()} is
 * the list of allowed IP endpoints (both local and remote) in the
 * "[hostname]:[port]" format (sans-quotes). [hostname] or [port] may be "*",
 * indicating that accessing any hostname, or port, is allowed.  Port may be 0,
 * which indicates that connections may be made to ephemeral ports from the same
 * process.  These ports must have been checked via {@link AllowNetworkListen} with
 * a port of 0 to be considered.
 *
 * This annotation is used to express both:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the permission to receive an incoming connection from a remote endpoint,
 * and</li>
 * <li>the permission to initiate an outgoing connection to a remote endpoint.</li>
 *
 * Note that due to performance restrictions, the {@link LessIOSecurityManager}
 * only performs textual matches, and does not resolve hostnames or IP
 * addresses.
